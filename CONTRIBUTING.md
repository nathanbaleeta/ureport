## Issue tracking

ureport-mobile uses GitHubâ€™s tracker called [Issues](https://github.com/unicef/ureport-mobile/issues) for easy collaboration among developers to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs during software sprints. A typical issue looks like this:
* A **title** and **description** describe what the issue is all about.
* Color-coded labels help you categorize and filter your issues (just like labels in email).
* A **milestone** acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating a group of issues with specific features or time period (e.g. Weekly Sprint 9/9-9/20 or FCM 1.0.0). 
* One **assignee** is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
* **Comments** allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.
