## Setting up your development environment
You will need a [text editor](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and an [phone devic emulator.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)

This is a starting point for new developers who wish to setup their development workstations' for Flutter mobile development.

1. Install Flutter on your workstation. Depending on your OS, follow the specific [instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Set up an editor of your choice ranging from Android Studio, Visual Studio Code to Emacs. Follow these [guidelines](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3. Create virtual devices using [AVD manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) to test drive your app during development. Maintain minimum API level of 24.

4. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/unicef/unicef-mobile.git`

Once it is done, you can modify any file locally and test drive the app using the phone emulator.

## Issue tracking

ureport-mobile uses GitHubâ€™s tracker called [Issues](https://github.com/unicef/ureport-mobile/issues) for easy collaboration among developers to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs during software sprints. A typical issue looks like this:
* A **title** and **description** describe what the issue is all about.
* Color-coded labels help you categorize and filter your issues (just like labels in email).
* A **milestone** acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating a group of issues with specific features or time period (e.g. Weekly Sprint 9/9-9/20 or FCM 1.0.0). 
* One **assignee** is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
* **Comments** allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.


## CI/CD
We use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for continuous integration to automatically run unit and integration tests before merging new code into the base branch.
